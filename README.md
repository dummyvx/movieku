# Movieku

A Responsive Web Application created using Next.js, Express.js, and Mongo Database. This site shows Movie and Series, and automatically update the data using Cronjob in Node.js. PS: I don't own any data.

## Get Started

To run this project, you can follow this following steps:

1. Clone this repo using git
2. Open terminal, and cd into `client` directory, and type `yarn` or `npm`.
3. Open another terminal, and start your mongodb service. Or if you don't use Mongodb locally, you can skip this step.
4. Open another terminal, and cd into `server` directory. Go to `/server` folder on this github project and read the `README.md` to run configure and run the server

## That's It

Happy Coding!
Please give a star to appreciate my work.
